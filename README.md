# HeartImage
Description: Create a beautiful image filled with hearts to spread love.

## 1st Rule DO NOT Open Testing Phase
Although you may be tempted to open it, let me explain this phase. I created it to transform an image into one made of the default hearts that appear on devices. These hearts are limited to only 12 colors, and Iâ€™m still figuring out how to transform them into full span of colors. By doing this, I can also generate a text file of emojis that resembles the original image. 

## Now the selfCreatedHearts
In this, I colored the hearts directly in the code itself, removing the dependency on heart emojis.
